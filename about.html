       <center>I chose Fate/Grand Order as my theme because not only do I enjoy the game itself, but I enjoy the Fate and Type-Moon franchise as a whole. Getting the chance to talk about some of the characters I am fond of is very welcome.
        <br>Fate/Grand Order is a gacha game based off of the Fate franchise incorporating a number of characters from each of its works such as Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Extra, Fate/Samurai Remnant, Fate/Apocrypha, and the works. If I were to name every single work F/GO drew from, this would be a giant list.
        <br>I first started playing the game back in 2020 when I was just about 14 and still play it to this day when I am 20, so I have a lot of history with it. I hope you enjoy the gallery and take some time to read more about the characters I included in this webpage. There would be much much more if I had the time.</center>
