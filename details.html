    <p> Tamamo-no-Mae<br>
        Class: Caster<br>
        Species: A lot of people think she's a fox, but as stated by herself, she is more close to a jackal. Foxes are cute though, so she presents herself as one.<br>
        She originates from the timeline of Fate/Extra as one of Hakuno Kishinami's summonable servants.<br>
        "I will always be there for you! Your reliable Shrine Maiden Fox, Caster, has now arrived!"</p>

        Skills<br>
        -----------------<br>
        Territory Creation [C]<br>
        This skill allows one to create a special terrain that is advantageous to oneself as a magus. Unfortunately for Tamamo-no-Mae, her personality is ill-suited for the task of manipulating reality and she has great difficulty even creating a small-scale crafting studio for creating minor amulets and other types of low-level talismans.<br>
        <br>
        Maleficium [EX]<br>
        The sacred rituals of the Dakini goddesses. The rituals confer the abilities to perform such actions as foretell the time and place of one's death and manipulate the hearts and minds of both men and women. Due to a number of very harsh lessons impressed upon her in the past, Tamano-no-Mae no longer make use of her still formidable skills in these areas.<br>
        <br>
        Transformation [A]<br>
        <br>
        This refers to the abilities of either changing ones appearance or borrowing the physical form of another. As a kitsune, or fox spirit, Tamano-no-Mae is able to alter her appearance and even species at will. However, due to a traumatizing event in a past incarnation that resulted in her death and temporary damnation, she rarely, if ever, uses this ability. <br>
        ----------------- <br>
        <br>

        Noble Phantasm <br>
        -----------------<br>
        The Eightfold Blessing of Amaterasu <br>
        <br>
        A mirror wielded by Tamamo-no-Mae. It is one of the sacred treasures brought down from the Heavens by the god Takehinateru-no-Mikoto and was oringally kept in the great shrine in the Izumo Province. According to passages in the Chronicles of Japan, the mirror was later moved to a site in the Kawachi district as the behest of the Imperial Court. <br><br> The mirror is also known as Yata-no-Kagami and is frequently used in rites honoring the sun goddess Amaterasu. In addition to its importance in ritual observances, it is also thought to possess the power to bring the dead back from the afterlife. However, since Caster's rebirth as a Servant, this power is no longer accessible. <br>
        -----------------
        


        <br><br>Caster is a magical fox girl servant, that much is clear. However- under the carefully (yet eccentric) persona she's created, is a lonely soul who only longed to be loved by another person.<br> 
        In her life as Tamamo-no-Mae, she was a consort for Emperor Toba of Imperial Japan. Posing as an ordinary girl, she was eventually outed as a spirit by an Onmyouji and blamed for the worsening condition of Emperor Toba at the time.<br>
        ...Unfortunately, the people did not see her for who she was, but what she was, and Tamamo was tragically slain defending herself from 80000 imperial soldiers, eyes ridden with tears at the betrayal of her love for humans.
